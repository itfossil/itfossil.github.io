      <description>So as was typical with my end of year posts that I used to make on my previous blog, this is an end of year post. All of my end of year posts are basically rants regarding the state of the world and the state of tech more specifically. This time around I am going to focus primarily on tech as there is only so much shit my brain can suffer through at once.</description>

      <description>On December 4th, 2024 somebody brazenly murdered the CEO of United Healthcare, Brain Thompson, in broad daylight. Health Insurance company executives around the country are wiping their websites of their identifying information in fear that any one of them might be next. Nationwide law enforcement is hunting for the shooter, but thus far he appears to have slipped through their fingers. What do I think? Well I hope he escapes because I love the smell of justice in the morning.</description>

      <description>So let&amp;rsquo;s get right down to it: If you use AI, you are a thief. If you don&amp;rsquo;t use AI and you have published content online that can be accessed without going through some sort of paywall, you have probably been robbed. Does this sound extreme? Well I&amp;rsquo;m truly sorry to say that it isn&amp;rsquo;t.&#xA;To those of you in the know, these statements are likely not going to shock you.</description>

      <description>Well its the day after the US Election and I&amp;rsquo;m more than a little shocked. Sure I learned the primary lesson of 2016 which was to &amp;ldquo;never count Trump out&amp;rdquo;, but despite that I went into the election last night thinking that a lot of the early indicators favored Harris. Obviously in the sobering light of mid-morning in which Trump has rightfully declared victory and thus far nearly every declared swing state seemed to go his way, this was tom-foolery.</description>

      <title>The Advice Trap</title>

      <description>So here you are. Back at the ITF blog, salivating at the mouth, hoping to read some more spicy confessionals bolstered by what I hope is a reasonably accurate sense of anonymity. Fair enough. Today&amp;rsquo;s confession is this: My advice is worthless.&#xA;There, I said it. Man it feels good to publish those words. Now don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I have been asked for advice a good bit over the years, especially when it comes to tech related subjects.</description>

      <description>So today while brainstorming new and exciting ways to conceal the fact that I&amp;rsquo;m a dinosaur and totally underqualified to hold my current position, I decided to take a quick break and catch up on one of my favorite tech blogs, Ludicity. For starters let me just say, if you are reading this blog and you aren&amp;rsquo;t reading that one, you should absolutely be reading that one too. If you only have time to read one of them, you should read his.</description>

      <description>On June 18th, 2023, a submersible called the Titan made its final trip down to the wreckage of Titanic (which is about 3800 meters beneath sea level). It was carrying five passengers, some of which had apparently paid serious money to be part of the voyage (tickets were reportedly 250k a pop). Somewhere along the way, something went wrong, the vessel imploded and the people on board died.&#xA;So why are we talking about this?</description>

      <title>The Surprisingly Empowering Loss of Zeal</title>

      <description>Promising to myself that I would figure out &amp;ldquo;something else to do with my life&amp;rdquo; within the next five to ten years has yielded some unexpected side effects. Namely I have started to become more detached from the day-to-day drama of working in the industry. This makes sense because if I don&amp;rsquo;t plan on working in tech five to ten years down the road, what difference does it really make? While this proclamation was at odds with my tradition of positioning of myself as a concerned craftsman, it does yield several benefits: Namely I&amp;rsquo;m not nearly as pissed off as I once was.</description>

      <description>Are you a manager desperate to cover up their own lack of productivity and general uselessness by implementing a system that will allow you to constantly lament your underlings apparent lack of productivity? Well if you are managing Software Engineers, I have some really good news to share with you today. Some people over at Microsoft Research, Github and the University of Victoria have devised the answer to all of your problems.</description>

      <description>I think the one thing that really ticks me off about this industry more than any other is the fact that we constantly treat our end users very poorly. Now those of you reading this are likely of one of two minds: Some amount of you think this is a very true statement and the rest of you think its complete and utter bollocks. Which group are you in?&#xA;Let me start off by explaining why I&amp;rsquo;m part of the former group.</description>

      <description>Over the years I&amp;rsquo;ve oscillated between reading quite a bit and reading not much at all. Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to read a lot more and the book I&amp;rsquo;m currently reading is called &amp;ldquo;System Error: Where Big Tech Went Wrong and How We Can Reboot&amp;rdquo;. Well while escorting my wife to a doctor&amp;rsquo;s appointment this morning I read a chapter that I found particularly striking as it spends most of it&amp;rsquo;s time dissecting this famous Donald Knuth quote:</description>

      <description>In case you didn&amp;rsquo;t know CrowdStrike makes anti-malware software for enterprises and they pushed out an update late last night that basically broke Windows machines running it. These machines need to be manually fixed via a process that involves either booting Windows into recovery or safe mode and then manually deleting the offending driver file. If your drive is encrypted this is made far more difficult by you having to manually key in your Bitlocker recovery key, assuming you even have access to it at all.</description>

      <description>Up front I&amp;rsquo;m going to say this: It&amp;rsquo;s really weird sitting down to write this blog post less than a day after former president Trump just survived an attempted assassination. While this post has been forming in my head over the last few days, give or take, it still feels weird to write about something that isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly at the top of my mind at the moment. One thing I&amp;rsquo;m sure of is that not only will the consequences of yesterday&amp;rsquo;s failed assassination be far reaching but that there will be plenty of time for content creators such as myself to more fully consider what those consequences are.</description>

      <description>If you are at all keeping up with the affairs of the world, then today you heard just as I did that the Supreme Court of the United States overwhelmingly granted immunity to the President of the United States for core and official acts while happily providing no framework for what constitutes an official act. I wish this was a joke or that I was not writing these words, but alas I&amp;rsquo;m not quite that big of a jerk and this actually happened.</description>

      <description>Over the years I&amp;rsquo;ve written a lot of blog posts that have danced around the argument I am about to make and the reason for that is very simple: I write proprietary software for a living. Expressing that opinion in a forum directly associated with my professional identity would essentially be career suicide.&#xA;So why am I doing it now? Well that&amp;rsquo;s the beauty of having an anonymous blog platform of course.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: Today&amp;rsquo;s post is going to be a good ole fashioned rant. The tech industry has lost its mind. If this is where you are hearing it for the first time, I need you to know that I won&amp;rsquo;t apologize for being the one to tell you. You were bound to find out sooner or later. What do I mean by this? Well pretty much everything is AI now. Nothing else matters.</description>

      <description>This is the final leg of my career as a software developer. I know that because I made a promise to myself. This is the kind of promise that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have dared to make even a few short years ago.

      <description>So between the end of my previous job and the beginning of my current job I took a few weeks off. Let&amp;rsquo;s be clear: by &amp;ldquo;off&amp;rdquo; I mean mostly stoned and chilling my ass out. My time off was refreshing and gave me an opportunity to not worry about anybody else&amp;rsquo;s tech / shit for two whole weeks. It&amp;rsquo;s been forever since I&amp;rsquo;ve had the chance to do that and I strongly urge any of you who have the opportunity and means to do it.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m sitting on my deck watching the remaining nub of the Black and Mild I have almost finished smoking smoulder into less than nothing. There are still a few more puffs to be had there, but in relatively short order our brief affair will end when this little baby cigar ends up being snuffed out of existence.</description>

Over the course of this career I have worked in all kinds of different scenarios which range from being the single IT resource that does it all for the client to playing a part on a well organized SCRUM team.</description>

      <description>So if you follow me on Mastodon you know that I&amp;rsquo;ve been deeply engrossed in my own job search as of late. Currently despite being a fossil, I&amp;rsquo;ve got two prospects that I&amp;rsquo;m juggling. One gave me an offer yesterday and I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to get an offer from the other one today. Despite my intense distaste for tech interviews, I went through the ringer with two companies at the same time and surprisingly managed to do rather well on the technical portions.</description>

      <description>Thus far I haven&amp;rsquo;t really indulged myself on this new blog. Tonight that changes. The content that I have already posted has basically been a slightly less PC version of content I once posted on my actual blog (now redacted so that I can appear sane and employable) back when that was a semi-functional entity of concern. Tonight I&amp;rsquo;m going to say a whole mess of shit that would basically amount to career suicide if I posted it on a medium that could be easily traced back to my actual identity.</description>
